                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <I>
                    <p>Hello! My name is Chrtistiana Tinkorang.
                        I grew up on the Oregon Coast. After graduation highschool
                        I attended BYUI and got my bachelors degree in Business Management. I met my husband 3 weeks
                        after I
                        got
                        to BYUI. We got married almost a year later. 12 years later we are now living in Saratoga
                        Springs
                        and
                        have 3 sweet kids.<br>


                        <br>I am a mom of 3, and have been a property manager for a few years. I have my mortgage
                        license
                        and
                        enjoy
                        working to help others.I love photography, traveling and exploring the great outdoors. For the
                        past
                        few
                        years I have been exploring different career options and have felt a little lost. I have learned
                        that as
                        a woman and as a mom its important for me to grow and show my kids especially my daughters that
                        their
                        mama can be sucessful too and can learn to be independant and strong and so can they. I am
                        excited
                        to
                        explore and learn more about the tech industry and really hope that I can find the job that I
                        will
                        be
                        sucessful at and will truly enjoy.
                    </p>
