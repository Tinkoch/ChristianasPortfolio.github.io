            <p class="AboutMe">
                <br><span class="enlarged-text1">Hello World!</span><br>
                <br><span class="enlarged-text2">My name is Christiana Tinkorang.</span><br>
                I hail from the picturesque Oregon coast, where the rugged beauty of the landscape
                inspired my love for
                photography and the great outdoors. Whether capturing the serene sunsets over the Pacific or
                trekking through lush
                forests, I find solace and joy in every frame I shoot. Alongside my passion for photography,
                I
                have found a love for traveling and seeking new adventures and experiences to broaden my horizons.
                Amidst my
                wanderlust,
                I've ventured out from my birthplace and currently reside in mountainous Utah. I cherish my roles
                as a devoted wife and a proud mother of three wonderful children, who continuously fill my life
                with love, laughter, and endless inspiration.<br>


                <br>
                In addition to my love for photography and the outdoors, I've discovered a newfound passion
                for art in the dynamic realm of website design and management within the tech world. As a proud member
                of Tech-Moms, I've
                delved into the intricacies
                of the tech industry, embracing the challenges and opportunities it presents. Currently
                serving as a business manager for T-Kay's Real Estate, I've honed my organizational and leadership
                skills, but my heart remains tethered to the
                creative realm. With a fervent desire to meld my passion for art and photography with the
                digital landscape, I aspire to
                transition into a career focused on web design, management, and advertising, where I can
                continue to express my creativity while making meaningful contributions to the online sphere.
